Issues:
  - The /monitors/<entry_type>/closest/ endpoint does not return a latest entry for the
    specified entry_type
  - The /monitors/<monitor_id>/entries/<entry_type>/ endpoint does not take into account
    timestamp__gte or timestamp__lte
  - The /monitors/<monitor_id>/ endpoint includes calibrations in latest entries instead of processor, and is the only endpoint to do so
