Issue:
  - The /monitors/<entry_type>/closest/ endpoint does not return a latest entry for the
    specified entry_type, and does not exclude inside monitors

Inconsistency (Doesn't really matter to me, just noting it in case it bothers you):
  - The /monitors/<monitor_id>/ endpoint includes calibrations in latest entries instead of processor, and is the only endpoint to do so
